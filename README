WIP Majora's Mask decomp, proper docs and README will be made later.

Basic steps (assuming you already have IDO and irixqemu):
Run extract_rom.py with a USA Majora's Mask ROM named baserom.z64 (will need to get libyaz0 first, I'll set up the dependency file eventually)
Run disasm.py
Run Make (edit the makefile with the paths to ido, etc. I'll make it use evironment variables eventually)
